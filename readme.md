## MAP STORIES MOBILE

Map Stories is a location based storytelling app. Editors can create map based stories and place markers on the map. Each marker is associated with an event, which has information and attachments.

The mobile app lets you add event's to your stories and uses your phone's camera and  GPS chip to add photo and location. You can use the regular Website (map-stories-frontend) to see the new event on the mapbox map.
